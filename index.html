      Hello! My name is Nicholas Cervania! I am a fourth year Software
      Engineering student at the Schulich School of Engineering at the
      University of Calgary. I am a dedicated, results-driven, team player with a
      passion for the design and build of innovative technologies.
      <br /><br />
      During my 12 months of internship, I had the privilege of working for <a href="http://www.optem.com/">OptEM
        Engineering</a>,
      where I was directly responsible for the full-stack development and design of the Assembly
      Window for software used for the virtual prototyping and anaylsis of high frequency electrical
      cable designs in <b>C#</b>.
      <br />
      My internship experience continued into my work at the <a href="https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/">Canadian Space
        Agency</a>, where I developed
      custom automation software for the efficient management and inspection of countless large technical
      documents in <b>C#</b> and <b>VBA</b>. By utilizing the Agile development process, I was able to
      work with the DevOps team to determine specific needs of the Exploration Ground Infrastructure department
      of the Space Exploration Branch. Alongside this, I also implemented unit tests using the .NET framework
      for new and existing features. My work was able to automate work that would have taken an
      unquantifiable amount of time to do manually.
      <br /><br />
      I have extensive experience in <b>Java</b> programming and have been using it
      as my main language since 2016. As a Lecture Coordinator of the
      organization, <a href="https://schulichignite.com/">Schulich Ignite</a>, I
      had an opportunity to learn more about Java and its capabilites, as well
      as give back to and educate other members of the community. The
      abundance of passion and enthusiasm I brought to each session paved the
      way for my position as President of the team, where I organized and
      coordinated multiple weekly learning sessions with over 100 students and
      mentors each. These mentors were interviewed personally by my team and
      I, and together we decided which mentors brought the most to the table.
      <br /><br />
      As a member of the
      <a href="https://www.calgarysolarcar.ca/">University of Calgary Solar Car team</a>, I have worked extensively with
      <b>C++</b> in the Qt environment. As part of
      my work on the Solar Car Team, I developed the GUI of the dashboard in
      Qt. The displays that I designed were used during the 2019 FSGP
      worldwide race and helped contribute to our team winning first place in
      the MOV category. Developing the dashboard has given me an incredible
      opportunity to apply my programming knowledge in unique and challenging
      situations while working in a team environment.
      <br /><br />
      The <a href="https://infosecucalgary.ca/">University of Calgary Information Security Club</a>
      has given me substantial exposure to information and cyber security. As a junior executive of this club,
      I helped to test weekly workshops covering topics regarding cyber security tools in <b>Linux</b> with CTF-style
      exercises. I was also able to successfully test several CTF challenges for the annual <a
        href="https://magpiectf.ca/">Magpie CTF Competition</a>.
      <br />
      In addition to the development of CTF challenges and weekly workshops, I competed on the executive team in several
      CTF competitions, including the <a href="https://www.bsidesedmonton.ca/ctf">2021 BSides Edmonton CTF</a>, <a
        href="https://k3rn3l4rmy.com/ctf">2021
        K3RN3LCTF</a>, <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/universities/university-ctf-2021">2021 HackTheBox Uni</a>.
      Our team also won first place in the <a href="https://cybersecuritychallenge.ca/">2022 CyberSci Regionals
        Competition</a>.
      <br /><br />

        Hello! My name is Nicholas Cervania! I am a 3rd year Software
        Engineering student at the Schulich School of Engineering at the
        University of Calgary. Due to the evolving situation with COVID-19, I am
        seeking a 12-16 month internship and am available starting June 1, 2020.
        I am a passionate, results-driven team player, with a passion for the
        design and build of innovative technologies.
        <br /><br />
        I have extensive experience in Java programming and have been using it
        as my main language since 2016. As a Lecture Coordinator of the
        organization <a href="https://schulichignite.com/">Schulich Ignite</a> I
        had an opportunity to learn more about Java and its capabilites, as well
        as give back to and educate other members of the community. The
        abundance of passion and enthusiasm I brought to each session paved the
        way for my position as President of the team, where I organized and
        coordinated multiple weekly learning sessions with over 100 students and
        mentors each. These mentors were interviewed personally by my team and
        I, and together we decided which mentors brought the most to the table.
        <br /><br />
        As a member of the
        <a href="https://www.calgarysolarcar.ca/"
          >University of Calgary Solar Car team</a
        >, I have worked extensively with C++ in the Qt environment. As part of
        my work on the Solar Car Team, I developed the GUI of the dashboard in
        Qt. The displays that I designed were used during the 2019 FSGP
        worldwide race and helped contribute to our team winning first place in
        the MOV category. Developing the dashboard has given me an incredible
        opportunity to apply my programming knowledge in unique and challenging
        situations while working in a team environment.

        <br /><br />
